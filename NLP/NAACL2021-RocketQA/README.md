# RocketQA
This is a repository of the paper: [RocketQA: An Optimized Training Approach to Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08191.pdf), NAACL 2021. 

## Introduction
RocketQA is an optimized training approach to improving dense passage retrieval. The three major technical contributions include cross-batch negatives, denoised hard negative sampling and data augmentation. 
The experiment results show that RocketQA significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on both MSMARCO and Natural Questions (NQ), and the performance of end-to-end QA can be improved based on RocketQA retriever.  
The pipeline of RocketQA training approach is shown as follows:

For a quick start, you can perform experiments from the fine-tuned checkpoints (i.e. skipping the first two steps of the training pipeline).

## Training
### Data processing
The training process consists 4 main steps, as described in section 4.3 in paper. The training samples for each step are different. Here, we provide scripts to construct training samples of MSMARCO and NQ respectively.  
*In our implementation of dual-encoder model, each sample contains 1 query with 1 positive passage and 1 hard negative passage for dual-encoder model.  
- For MSMARCO:  
    - Step1: In this step, we construct training data for first duel-encoder model (M<sub>D</sub><sup>(0)</sup>). For consistency with the last two steps, we add 4 negative passages randomly sampled from all candidate passages for each query, although there is no hard negative in this step. （For NQ, we directly use the data released by [DPR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR), which contains hard negatives sampled from top-100 passages retrieved by ES.）   
    - Step2: In this step, we construct training data for cross-encoder (MC). Once the top K passages for each training query have been retrieved by M<sub>D</sub><sup>(0)</sup> (<u>`$recall_topk_file`</u>, format as: qid \t pid \t rank \t score), one can get the training data by running the following command:
        ```
        python construct_marco_train_ce.py $recall_topk_file $output_file
        ```
    - Step3: In this step, we construct training data for dual-encoder with denoised hard negatives. After scoring top N of recalled candidates by cross-encoder M<sub>C</sub>, you can get <u>`$ce_score_topN_file`</u> (format as: a score each line). To get the training data, run
        ```
        python construct_marco_train_de.py $recall_topk_file $ce_score_topN_file $output_file
        ```
    - Step4: For unlabeled queries, first retrieval top K passages on MSMARCO corpus by dual-encoder M<sub>D</sub><sup>(1)</sup> (<u>`$recall_topk_file`</u>), and then score the query-paragraph pairs by cross-encoder M<sub>C</sub> (<u>`$ce_score_topN_file`</u>). To get augment training data, run
        ```
        python construct_unlabel_train_de.py $recall_topk_file $ce_score_topN_file $output_file marco
        ```
        Then, merge augment data with training data in step3 to get final training data for step4.  

- For NQ, the corresponding commands are as follows: 
    ```
    python construct_nq_train_ce.py $recall_topk_file $output_file     
    python construct_nq_train_de.py $recall_topk_file $ce_score_topN_file $output_file         
    python construct_unlabel_train_de.py $recall_topk_file $ce_score_topN_file $output_file nq
    ```

### Dual-encoder training
To train a dual-encoder model, run
```
cd model
sh script/run_dual_encoder_train.sh $TRAIN_SET $MODEL_PATH $epoch $nodes
```

### Dual-encoder inference
To do the inference of dual-encoder and get top K retrieval results (relay on FAISS), run
```
sh script/run_retrieval.sh $TEST_SET $MODEL_PATH $DATA_PATH $TOP_K
```
Here we separate whole candidate passages into 8 parts, and predict their embeddings with 8 GPU cards simultaneously. After getting top K results on each part, we merge them to get the final recall file. (ie. <u>`$recall_topk_file`</u> in Data Processing)

### Cross-encoder training
To train a cross-encoder model, run
```
sh script/run_cross_encoder_train.sh $TRAIN_SET $MODEL_PATH $epoch $node
```

### Cross-encoder inference
To get the predicted scores of topN query-paragraphs pair (ie. <u>`$ce_score_topN_file`</u> in Data Processing), run
```
sh script/run_cross_encoder_test.sh $TEST_SET $MODEL_PATH
```

### The Training Procedure
To reproduce the results of the paper, you can follow the commands in **```run_marco.sh```** / **```run_nq.sh```**. These scripts contain the entire process of RocketQA. Each part depends on the result of the previous step. Since we have given some processed training data and trained models, you can start from any step.

Tips: remember to specify GPU cards before training by
```
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,xxx
```

## Evaluation
To evaluate on MSMARCO development set, run
```
python metric/msmarco_eval.py corpus/marco/qrels.dev.tsv $recall_topk_file
```
To evaluate on NQ test set, run
```
python metric/nq_eval.py $recall_topk_file
```

\*\*The result of the last step on NQ might be slightly different from the result reported in the paper, because we lost the original model file. We re-train the model and provide the checkpoint.  

## Passage Reading
We verify whether the retrieval results of RocketQA can improve the performance of passage reading for extracting correct answers. We use the implement of extractive reader published in [DPR](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DPR). We first reuse the released reader model of DPR, and take 100 retrieved passages during inference (the same setting used in DPR), which achieve 42.0 EM.  Besides, we use the same setting to train a new extractive reader based on the retrieval results of RocketQA (except that we choose top 50 passages for training instead of 100). After reconstructing the training data and retraining, we get a result of 42.8.
